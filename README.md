# Fuzzy Controller for Cart & Inverse Pendulum Problem

There are 2 Consecutive fuzzy contollers are used, each with 25 rules, not only to maintain the stability of the pendulum but also to order the cart to get to the desired location only by changing the angle of pendulum.
The dynamics of the problem is modeled with SIMmechanics by Simulink.
